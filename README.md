This repository contains (or will contain) code for downloading data from the
bittrex cryptocurrency exchange, manipulating the data to make predictions for
a trading strategy, and executing those strategies through an account on the
exchange.

The `notebooks` directory holds various jupyter notebooks with analysis of
some coin data using different statistical models. This analysis will be built
into a trading strategy to be implemented on the exchange.

No guarantee can be made for the use of this code to learn anything useful
about the fickle ways of the cryptocurrency markets.
